// Monotonic Stack
//
// A monotonic stack is a stack data structure that maintains its elements in
// either an increasing or decreasing order. Here are its key properties:
//
// 1. Order Maintenance:
//   - In a Monotonic Increasing Stack, each new element pushed onto the stack
//     is greater than or equal to the element at the top of the stack.
//   - In a Monotonic Decreasing Stack, each new element pushed onto the stack
//     is less than or equal to the element at the top of the stack.
// 2. Efficiency:
//   - It allows for efficient retrieval of the next greater or next smaller
//     element in a sequence, typically in linear time `O(n)`.
// 3. Dynamic Updates:
//   - As elements are added or removed, the stack dynamically maintains its
//     monotonic property, ensuring that the operations of pushing and popping
//     elements are efficient.
// 4. Application:
//   - Monotonic stacks are commonly used in problems involving the next greater
//     element, next smaller element, stock span problems, and histogram
//     problems.
