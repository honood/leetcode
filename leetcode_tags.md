    A monotonic stack is a stack data structure that maintains its elements in either an increasing or decreasing order. Here are its key properties:

    1. Order Maintenance:
        - In a **Monotonic Increasing Stack**, each new element pushed onto the stack is greater than or equal to the element at the top of the stack.
        - In a **Monotonic Decreasing Stack**, each new element pushed onto the stack is less than or equal to the element at the top of the stack.
    2. Efficiency:
        - It allows for efficient retrieval of the next greater or next smaller element in a sequence, typically in linear time `O(n)`.
    3. Dynamic Updates:
        - As elements are added or removed, the stack dynamically maintains its monotonic property, ensuring that the operations of pushing and popping elements are efficient.
    4. Application:
        - Monotonic stacks are commonly used in problems involving the next greater element, next smaller element, stock span problems, and histogram problems.

52. [Monotonic Queue (15)](https://leetcode.com/tag/monotonic-queue/)

    A monotonic queue is a data structure that is used to maintain the elements in a specific order (either increasing or decreasing) to quickly find the minimum or maximum within a sliding window. The key property of a monotonic queue is that its elements are ordered in a way that facilitates constant-time retrieval of the minimum or maximum value.

    ## Key Features:
    1. **Monotonic Increasing Queue**: Elements in the queue are arranged such that each successive element is greater than or equal to the previous one. This facilitates quick access to the maximum value within the current sliding window.
    2. **Monotonic Decreasing Queue**: Elements in the queue are arranged such that each successive element is less than or equal to the previous one. This structure enables efficient retrieval of the minimum value within the current sliding window.

    ## Usage:
    - Monotonic queues are particularly useful for problems where you need to find extreme values (maximum or minimum) over every possible contiguous subarray (sliding window) of a given size in an array.

    ## Implementation:
    - Data Structure: Implemented typically using a deque (double-ended queue) in programming languages like C++ or Python, allowing efficient insertion and deletion operations from both ends.
    - Algorithm:
        1. Iterate through the array while maintaining the monotonic property of the queue.
        2. Adjust the queue to ensure it reflects the monotonic nature as new elements are added or as the sliding window moves.
        3. Retrieve extreme values (maximum or minimum) from the queue as the sliding window moves across the array.

    Monotonic queues offer a time-efficient solution (often O(n) complexity) to sliding window problems where maintaining the order of elements is crucial for quick retrieval of extreme values within each window.
